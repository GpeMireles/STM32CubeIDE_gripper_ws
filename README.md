# STM32CubeIDE_gripper_ws
## This repository contains a collection of unit tests and integration tests written in STM32CubeIDE. These tests are designed to achieve closed-loop control of a gripper, utilizing two servo motors and three sensors as feedback. The feedback sensors consist of one potentiometers for each servo and a push button for the gripper.

### Note: The projects are configured for a STM32F401CCUx board, we used a STM32F401CCU6 (Black pill)
